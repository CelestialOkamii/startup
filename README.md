# Ducks in a Row
 _When life gives you tough relatives, make fashionable ducks!_

## Elevator Pitch

Have your parents, in-laws, or other family members ever gotten on you about how **great** your cousin Johnny is compared to you? Have they ever said that **your life is a mess** and that Aunt Susan's daughter practically saved an orphanage by volunteering there for a summer? If you've have heard these or other similar comparisons before, then Ducks in a Row may be the theraputic solution for you! Ducks in a Row is a website where you can customize a duck and give it a title that pertains to your own good points. These titles are entirely up the the user and can be anything from **3.6 GPA** to **I didn't wake up in a dumpster today**! The point of making and showcasing these ducks is to remember that while Grandpa Leo may have been a hotshot in his day, you're doing pretty alright too! While you customize your ducks, you can release your pent up frustrations and, if you feel like sticking it to the man, or in this case beloved family members, then you can also show off your ducks to them or friends!

## Techonologies
- **HTML:** Correctly uses HTML structure in Website. Three pages.
  1. Login
  2. Homepage with past ducks in a row and place to view received duck rows/send duck rows
  3. Ducks in Row customization page
  4. Using Random Useless Facts for customization page.
- **CSS:** Vibrant application that adjusts well to a vaviety of screen sizes. Background of soft pastels with ducks and items suck as login and links to other pages being the vibrant pops of color to draw the eye.

## HTML 
- [x] **HTML pages** - Four HTML pages that allow the user to login, view their own and other ducks, create new ducks, or send ducks to friends.
- [x] **Links** - The Login page links to the home page after clicking Login. The home page links to the duck customization page and send ducks page through buttons. There is also a link at the bottom of the login page that links to my Git repository and a button on the customization page that will link to a 3rd party that will provide a random fact.
- [x] **Text** - There is text that indicates where the user should type information on the login, customize ducks, and send ducks pages. In addition, there is a button that will generate text containing a random fact and attribution to the creater of the images used on every page.
- [X] **Images** - I have non moving temporarily uncustomizable images on every page as placeholders for when I can make them interactive.
- [x] **DB/Login** - I have input boxes for the user to put their username and password and a button to log them in. The database is represented by the select drop down menus that will store customization options, names of past creations, and friends names.
- [x] **WebSocket** - The Across the Pond duck pond is a placeholder for a non static image that will show ducks being sent to you by friends.
