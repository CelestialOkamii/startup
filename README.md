# Ducks in a Row
 _When life gives you tough relatives, make fashionable ducks!_

## Elevator Pitch

Have your parents, in-laws, or other family members ever gotten on you about how **great** your cousin Johnny is compared to you? Have they ever said that **your life is a mess** and that Aunt Susan's daughter practically saved an orphanage by volunteering there for a summer? If you've have heard these or other similar comparisons before, then Ducks in a Row may be the theraputic solution for you! Ducks in a Row is a website where you can customize a duck and give it a title that pertains to your own good points. These titles are entirely up the the user and can be anything from **3.6 GPA** to **I didn't wake up in a dumpster today**! The point of making and showcasing these ducks is to remember that while Grandpa Leo may have been a hotshot in his day, you're doing pretty alright too! While you customize your ducks, you can release your pent up frustrations and, if you feel like sticking it to the man, or in this case beloved family members, then you can also show off your ducks to them or friends!
